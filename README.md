# aframe-examples
A repository containing a variety of re-usable A-Frame components, and examples of A-Frame component usage.

Content is currently organized into:

- components - Re-usable A-Frame components (now maintained at [`aframe-components`](https://github.com/diarmidmackenzie/aframe-components))
- compositions - More complex examples that involve composition of multiple A-Frame components.



## Components

------------

#### The components in this repo are now maintained in my [`aframe-components`](https://github.com/diarmidmackenzie/aframe-components) repo.  Components are left here so that they are available for pre-existing users (prior to January 2023) who use them via CDN.

#### Please migrate to using the  [`aframe-components`](https://github.com/diarmidmackenzie/aframe-components) repo if you can.
